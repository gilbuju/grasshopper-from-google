Grasshopper
App from Google to learn how to code in Javascript using gamification
This course uses Javascript, but the concepts can be applied to any coding language

  What is code? 
    Code is the name we give to the language we use to talk to computers
    A computer reads code the same way we read: starting at the top and working down
    Javascript can create websites, applications, analyze data and animate shapes

  Fundamentals
    Functions, create variables, control code flow

    Drawing shapes
#        drawbow(blue)
         you can use different colors as an argument to this function: yellow, blue, white, green, red, black etc
#        newline()
         function to put the cursor at the next line. If you do not put any number between parentheses, it's just one line
         A function tells a computer to do a certain thing. Functions can take arguments to give the computer extra information. 
#        drawboxes()
         useful to draw a lot of boxes with less lines of code
#        'g': green
         'r': red
         'bwb': blue white blue
         'b w b': blue at first line, white at the second and blue at the final line. Yeah, space bar in this case, has the same newline()'s result 
#        string:In this function, we start to use singular quotes ' '. These quotation marks show a string to the computer. String is letters, words and sentences in  coding.      
#         pickrandom()
          Function to create random results depending of your argument. Example: drawbox(pickrandom(color))      
   Variables    
#         var
          Variables store information you can use later in your code without having to rewrite it.        
          var x = blue; drawbox(x); var x = yellow; drawbox(x); var month = 'Gilmar'; print(month)
          The functions as print, drawbox, drawboxes and other are going to run with the last information uploaded at the code
   Arrays
#         []
          array is a list of items and the items have commas between them. The items can be different data types like numbers, strings, and even other arrays (called array nesting")
#         Array indexing: when you put the array's name and right after without space:[], into them, you can put numbers from 0 (first element from your array) to infinite
   If Statements
